In this one we study conditions on a functor to be algebraically compact, which means that the canonical comparison morphism between those objects is an isomorphism."

	abstract = "We describe a fully abstract trace semantics for a functional language with locally declared general references (a fragment of Standard ML). It is based on a bipartite LTS in which states alternate between program and environment configurations and labels carry only (sets of) basic values, location and pointer names. Interaction between programs and environments is either direct (initiating or terminating subprocedures) or indirect (by the overwriting of shared locations): actions reflect this by carrying updates to the shared part of the store. The trace-sets of programs and contexts may be viewed as deterministic strategies and counter-strategies in the sense of game semantics: we prove soundness of the semantics by showing that the evaluation of a program in an environment tracks the interaction between the corresponding strategies. We establish full abstraction by proving a definability result: every bounded deterministic strategy of a given type is the trace-set of a configuration of that type.",

abstract = {A right adjoint functor is said to be of descent type if the counit of the adjunction is pointwise a coequalizer. Building on the results of Tholen's doctoral thesis, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a composite to be of descent type when each factor is so. We apply this to show that every finitary monad on a locally-finitely-presentable enriched category A admits a presentation in terms of basic operations and equations between derived operations, the arties here being the finitely-presentable objects of A.}

We work within a general, category-theoretic framework for various notions of “relation” on domains and for actions of domain constructors on relations. Freyd's analysis of recursive types in terms of a property of mixed initiality/finality is transferred to a corresponding property ofinvariantrelations. The existence of invariant relations is proved under completeness assumptions about the notion of relation. We show how this leads to simpler proofs of the computational adequacy of denotational semantics for functional programming languages with user-declared datatypes. We show how the initiality/finality property of invariant relations can be specialized to yield an induction principle for admissible subsets of recursively defined domains, generalizing the principle of structural induction for inductively defined sets. We also show how the initiality/finality property gives rise to the co-induction principle studied by the author. [Theoret. Comput. Sci.124, 195–219 (1994)], by which equalities between elements of recursively defined domains may be proved via an appropriate notion of “bisimulation.”}

abstract = {The aim of this work is largely a practical one. A widely employed style of programming, particularly in structure-processing languages which impose no discipline of types, entails defining procedures which work well on objects of a wide variety. We present a formal type discipline for such polymorphic procedures in the context of a simple programming language, and a compile time type-checking algorithm W which enforces the discipline. A Semantic Soundness Theorem (based on a formal semantics for the language) states that well-type programs cannot “go wrong” and a Syntactic Soundness Theorem states that if W accepts a program then it is well typed. We also discuss extending these results to richer languages; a type-checking algorithm based on W is in fact already implemented and working, for the metalanguage ML in the Edinburgh LCF system.}

Two formulations of recursive types exist: iso-recursive and equi-recursive. The relative advantages of iso- and equi-recursion are well- studied when it comes to their impact on type-inference. However, the relative semantic expressiveness of the two formulations remains unclear so far. This paper studies the semantic expressiveness of STLC with iso- and equi-recursive types, proving that these formulations are equally expressive. In fact, we prove that they are both as expressive as STLC with only term-level recursion. We phrase these equi-expressiveness results in terms of full abstraction of three canonical compilers between these three languages (STLC with iso-, with equi-recursive types and with term-level recursion). Our choice of languages allows us to study expressiveness when interacting over both a simply-typed and a recursively-typed interface. The three proofs all rely on a typed version of a proof technique called approximate backtranslation. Together, our results show that there is no difference in semantic expressiveness between STLCs with iso- and equi-recursive types. In this paper, we focus on a simply-typed setting but we believe our results scale to more powerful type systems like System F.},

Soundness of important Scala features therefore remains an open problem in theory and in practice. To address some of these problems, we use a semantics-first approach to develop a logical relations model for a new version of DOT, called guarded DOT (gDOT). Our logical relations model makes use of an abstract form of step-indexing, as supported by the Iris framework, to model various forms of recursion in gDOT. To demonstrate the expressiveness of gDOT, we show that it handles Scala examples that could not be handled by previous versions of DOT, and prove using our logical relations model that gDOT provides the desired data abstraction. The gDOT type system, its semantic model, its soundness proofs, and all examples in the paper have been mechanized in Coq.},

abstract = {We present a logical relations model of a higher-order functional programming language with impredicative polymorphism, recursive types, and a Haskell-style ST monad type with runST. We use our logical relations model to show that runST provides proper encapsulation of state, by showing that effectful computations encapsulated by runST are heap independent. Furthermore, we show that contextual refinements and equivalences that are expected to hold for pure computations do indeed hold in the presence of runST. This is the first time such relational results have been proven for a language with monadic encapsulation of state. We have formalized all the technical development and results in Coq.},

abstract="We present a sound and complete proof technique, based on syntactic logical relations, for showing contextual equivalence of expressions in a $\lambda$-calculus with recursive types and impredicative universal and existential types. Our development builds on the step-indexed PER model of recursive types presented by Appel and McAllester. We have discovered that a direct proof of transitivity of that model does not go through, leaving the ``PER'' status of the model in question. We show how to extend the Appel-McAllester model to obtain a logical relation that we can prove is transitive, as well as sound and complete with respect to contextual equivalence. We then augment this model to support relational reasoning in the presence of quantified types.",

abstract = {We present a complete reasoning principle for contextual equivalence in an untyped probabilistic language. The language includes continuous (real-valued) random variables, conditionals, and scoring. It also includes recursion, since the standard call-by-value fixpoint combinator is expressible. We demonstrate the usability of our characterization by proving several equivalence schemas, including familiar facts from lambda calculus as well as results specific to probabilistic programming. In particular, we use it to prove that reordering the random draws in a probabilistic program preserves contextual equivalence. This allows us to show, for example, that (let x = e1 in let y = e2 in e0) =ctx (let y = e2 in let x = e1 in e0) (provided x does not occur free in e2 and y does not occur free in e1) despite the fact that e1 and e2 may have sampling and scoring effects.},

We show how to construct step-indexed logical relations for a probabilistic extension of a higher-order programming language with impredicative polymorphism and recursive types. We show that the resulting logical relation is sound and complete with respect to the contextual preorder and, moreover, that it is convenient for reasoning about concrete program equivalences. Finally, we extend the language with dynamically allocated first-order references and show how to extend the logical relation to this language. We show that the resulting relation remains useful for reasoning about examples involving both state and probabilistic choice.",

abstract = {A capability machine is a type of CPU allowing fine-grained privilege separation using capabilities, machine words that represent certain kinds of authority. We present a mathematical model and accompanying proof methods that can be used for formal verification of functional correctness of programs running on a capability machine, even when they invoke and are invoked by unknown (and possibly malicious) code. We use a program logic called Cerise for reasoning about known code, and an associated logical relation, for reasoning about unknown code. The logical relation formally captures the capability safety guarantees provided by the capability machine. The Cerise program logic, logical relation, and all the examples considered in the paper have been mechanized using the Iris program logic framework in the Coq proof assistant. The methodology we present underlies recent work of the authors on formal reasoning about capability machines [15, 33, 37], but was left somewhat implicit in those publications. In this paper we present a pedagogical introduction to the methodology, in a simpler setting (no exotic capabilities), and starting from minimal examples. We work our way up to new results about a heap-based calling convention and implementations of sophisticated object-capability patterns of the kind previously studied for high-level languages with object-capabilities, demonstrating that the methodology scales to such reasoning.},
