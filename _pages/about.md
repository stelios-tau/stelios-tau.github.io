Hello! Nice to see you here :).

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Theoretical Computer Science group](https://www8.cs.fau.de/) at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. Starting from **February 2025**, I will be a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU), in the [ACP Section](https://acp.sdu.dk/).

I like working on the categorical foundations of computer science and applications thereof, currently focusing on programming languages and security, and more specifically on:

- Foundations of Programming Languages
- Formal Methods
- Secure Compilation

I am actively developing the [Higher-order Abstract GSOS](https://www.steliostsampas.com/projects/higher-order/) (HO-GSOS) framework. The current running grant on HO-GSOS is [ATLaS](https://www.steliostsampas.com/projects/atlas/).
