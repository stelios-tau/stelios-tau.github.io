Hello! Nice to see you here :).

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Theoretical Computer Science group at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. I like working on the categorical foundations of computer science and applications thereof, currently focusing on programming languages and security, and more specifically on:

- Foundations of Programming Languages
- Formal Methods
- Secure Compilation

**Starting from February 2025, I will be an Assistant Professor at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU), joining the ACP Section.**
