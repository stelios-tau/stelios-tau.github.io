The project *ATLaS: Abstract Techniques for Programming Languages and Secure Compilation* is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the German Research Foundation, and has a three-year duration, from 01.2024 to 12.26.

The aim of the project is to work on various important aspects of [Higher-order Abstract GSOS](https://www.steliostsampas.com/projects/higher-order/).
